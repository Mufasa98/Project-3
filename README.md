# A Comprehensive Analysis of Student Academics Correlation with Retention and Graduation Rates
##Team 10 Members: Francis Crawford, Mufasa Naeem, Isabelle Roetcisoender, Isabel Sy

The purpose of this project is to showcase knowledge reflective of course materials including data and delivery, back end knowledge, and visualizations. This project will cover the correlation between student academics or test scores (SAT and ACT scores), student retention rates, and student graduation rates. The information for this project is sourced from the United States Department of Education's [CollegeScoreCard website](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/). This website is an online tool with data on college costs, graduation, and post-college earnings. The following components are covered in this project: 

## Data and Delivery
The requirements for data and delivery include clearly documented data components, a dataset that contains 500 unique records, and a database used to house the data. The project must be powered by Python Flask API and includes HTML/CSS, Javascript, and the chosen database. This analysis includes: 
```
-An API key generated by the CollegeScoreBoard site 
-A forloop that loops through pages of the necessary information to fulfill dataset requirements including:
##demographics (admissions test requirements, completion rate demographics, student demographics, median debt per demographic, faculty demographics, religious affiliation, and undergrads age 25 and above)
##income (students with low income, middle income and high income categorized by: general completion, general withdrew, transferred and withdrew, and transferred and completed)
##gender (students by male or female categorized by: general completion, general withdrew, transferred and withdrew, transferred and completed
##background (students financially independent/dependent, first gen, first gen tranfered to 4 year, via census data demographics (population of students by zipcode), died, independent/dependent/non-first gen/first gen categorized by: general completion, general withdrew, transferred and withdrew, transferred and completed)
##academics (enrollment, school specifics, tuition fees, highest degree awarded, test scores by SAT and ACT, retention rate, cost, control of the institution, less than 4 year first-time full-time, and 4 year first-time full-time)
##response (school city/classifications, costs, FAFSA, completion time by program, average net price, and admission rate)
```

## Back End 
The requirement for the back end portion includes a page created to show data visualization that runs without error, a leaflet or plotly chart built from data gathered through webscraping, and a dashboard page with multiple charts that all reference the same data. This analysis includes: 
```-text

```
## Visualizations 
The requirement for the visualizations portion includes a minimum of three unique views to reflect the data, multiple user-driven interactions, and a final page with user-friendly visualizations. This analysis includes :
```-text
